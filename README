rpmdev-bumpver
==============

Just like the rpmdev-bumpspec can bump a release number this script
allows you to bump a version number for simple update.

The only items changed are:
- the Version, set to the one you specify or simply update +1
- the Release, set back to 1
- the Changelog

If you do not provide your username, it will try to guess it from
your Fedora certificate.
If you do not provide your email, it will use your @fedoraproject.org
alias if he could determine your username.

Dependencies:
  - fedora-cert
